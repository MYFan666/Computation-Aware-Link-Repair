This paper proposed a computation-aware link repair (CALR) algorithm to meet the computation demands of data centers in heavily damaged Distributed Cloud Networks.

In the document **Supplementary Material for ''Computation-Aware Link Repair for Large-Scale Damage in Distributed Cloud Networks"**, we present the detailed derivations for the problem DSP.
