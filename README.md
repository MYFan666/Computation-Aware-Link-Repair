This paper presents a computation-aware link repair (CALR) scheme for large-scale distributed cloud network damage, which could effectively alleviate the conflict between finite repair resources and massive data processing requirements at the initial stage of network recovery.

In the document **Supplementary Material for ''Computation-Aware Link Repair for Large-Scale Damage in Distributed Cloud Networks"**, we present the detailed derivations for the problem DSP.
